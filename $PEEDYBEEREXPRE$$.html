        <h1>$PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>**Note before beginning: the basis of this idea is the same as LONEBAR BEER$$$4U that was at Freezerburn 2020. I was given the rights by the creators of it because they are all in Colorado, and I volunteered for it and thought I could have more fun with it. The original creators are Aerica Raven, Steve Ward, Ross Moffett, Misty Nickle, Seph Reed, and Stephanie Crane. For the purpose of this piece I will be using their materials with their consent, BUT the final product will be tweaked a lot more to fit the aesthetic I'm attempting to convey. **

    The major purpose of the piece is interactivity, however it will require staff like it were an actual bar camp/theme camp. Participants will fill out "credit check" -style form to be "loaned" a beverage (beer or non-alcoholic soda).  If the credit score is high, a "loan" is approved and the participant agrees to the terms as set by the bar. There is quite a bit of shtick involved in the process of the application, basically done with the hope that the person actually WILL bring the beer back later because they already had done so much rigmarole. Also '$PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$' will be conveniently located for returning beverages, hopefully.

    Most burners will not instantly have good credit to get something from us unless they are volunteers//doing us favors in exchange. We have a budding quest system for these occurrences, the purpose of which is to get every participant to go somewhere they haven't yet//do an activity at ANOTHER camp that they should do, go find something we've planted elsewhere, etc. Afterwards they can come back with proof to the $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$ and redeem those things for beer/sticker/polaroid photograph (with their consent) and other small trinket prizes we're still workshopping.

    There is so much extra beer (and soda water! We are going to offer hydration at the same rates as beer) at Flipside, so hopefully this project will cycle through extra beer at a modest exchange. We are going to start with seed capital, of course, of having our own beers to give out. So in short, after a "loan" a participant would "owe" us and that debt may be leveraged one way or another. Some of those things are games, normal fetch quests (detailed below), go "advertise" for us, etc. The easiest way, of course, is to just give us a couple of beers back so the cycle can continue with other participants. We are looking to keep burners engaged and this is our way to foster community/ingratiate ourselves in other camps we all know by now.

So basically the idea is pay-it-forward for a bar camp. I saw this idea work before, and hopefully the conditions would be right for it to work at Flipside. There are a lot of considerations to maintain, but I think we are funny, composed individuals who can create a humorous lived experience for any number of Flipizens.

        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>I have only participated in other people's projects before (particularly Ben with the swamp creatures//Japanese Torii gate at Freezerburn 2023). I have rudimentary carpentry skills and have built things of similar size before. Basically the whole thing will need about 120 feet of 2"x4", three 4'x8' plywood panels, bamboo poles (sourced free and sustainably), tarps, and paint. It's not especially hard carpentry, and I have built things such as sheds, porches, shelves, podiums, et al in the past. I volunteered on set building in theater during high school, college, and briefly at Salvage Vanguard Theater back in 2010 - 2012.

I built a small art podium that I displayed at Freezerburn 2023 in the woods, called "The Book of the Eternal [good time]" that I made out of scrap wood and $25 of paint and cloth.

However the strength of this is piece is PERFORMANCE art, and I think we have that in spades. I have 15 years of customer service experience, 10 years of comedy, and am able to make people laugh and get an idea when the shtick does and doesn't land. I've been a trivia host, a *fake* paparazzi photographer, a carnival barker, and an opening act for much more dedicated comedians. Moreover, I think I can run a team of like-minded friends who are just looking to pass out beer, get people engaged in their burn, make them laugh and remember $PEEDY BEER EXPRE$$.
