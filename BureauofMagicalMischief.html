        <h3>Bureau of Magical Mischief</h3><p>Participants will fill out an application to be an agent of the Bureau of Magical Mischief. We will review applications and create a handful of custom missions for them which we think will be entertaining and insightful and helpful and kind. When they arrive at the event, they will scan their ID card at the device or input an ID number, which will keep track of the missions they have completed so far, and offer them a choice of a new one. The missions will be designed to do one or more of: build self-confidence, get unstuck, push boundaries, connect with others, discover something about oneself or one's relationships, etc.</p>

<h3>Power</h3><p>Yes</p>
<h3>Power Plan</h3><p>It's just small electronics, so hopefully a big battery. Maybe a camp genny.</p>
<h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3><p>No</p>
<h3>SafetyPlan</h3><p></p>
<h3>OtherProjects</h3><p>I brought Be You Now to Flipside a few years ago. It was a humanoid effigy that everyone wrote their "other possible you that will never exist" on it and then we burned it together. I have been dabbling with the electronics parts for years and have the prototype working as seen in the picture (the cardboard box is not it's final housing).</p>

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>Planning/creation is underway and will continue to be refined until the event. Installment is just hooking up power and turning it on. There will be minimal maintenance throughout the event (adding paper for the printer). LNT just turn it off and take it home.</p>
<h3>HowMuch</h3><p>575</p>
