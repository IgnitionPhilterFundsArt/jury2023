        <h3>TimeLine</h3>
        <p>Last year at Flipside, CREATE went really great!  So many people came and painted with us.  I learned a lot on what worked and what didn't.  There is still a lot of canvas at the middle and top that needs painting.  I need to get more bright colored paint and brushes for people to help finish off the canvas.  I need to get a few more blue tarps to place right under the canvas that helped with paint drips.</p>
