        <h3>CUDL Crypto ICO</h3><p>

(This part is an unannounced twist that we"d like to stay off any public descriptions)

CUDL is a commentary on cryptocurrency and serves as a front for our real project - WHARRGARBL.

The CUDL group will have officials in miner outfits with clipboards monitoring cuddle spaces around the event and updating a tracker with the current price of the currency, which will be represented by and handed out via physical tokens (laser cut acrylic).  The Thursday and Friday activities will primarily be promoting the ICO on Friday night including a stage, projections, lights, and sound setup.

The CUDL ICO is interrupted by the ritualistic slaying of its promoter, Santoshi Winklevoss, by WHARRGARBL, an alien metal band who traveled to earth to use mankind"s own traits to help destroy it. Based on the music and styling of GWAR, our project hopes to bring a few unique things to Flipside:

* Metal
* Social commentary on what is destroying humanity
* Metal
* A critique on mankind's lust for wealth and advancement
* Metal

Okay, really we just wanna play a surprise metal show on the effigy field on Friday night.

WHARRGARBL as a band has been together since 2022"s post-Flipside primordial soup of 2023 ideas with the sole/soul purpose of creating a show at Burning Flipside 2023. In this grant, we're asking for funding to build badass costumes for each of our band members so they can fully embody their characters/paths to destruction for humanity, they are:

* Mr. Fistoffaleez (Brandt) - Fetishization of violence
* Judge Jerry Executioner (Adrian) - Facism and government oppression
* Crypto Destructo (Joe) - Boiling the oceans or getting rich trying
* D.P. Morgan (Tom) - Unbridled capitalism
* Thicc Dickins (Damien) - Apathy and avoidance

WHARGHARBL is managed by Toxic Positivity (Winnie Hsia) who has been attending, volunteering, organizing, and leading projects at Burning Flipside since 2007. She is the owner of Sky Candy and has produced countless burlesque, aerial, and even a couple live music shows. With her extensive managerial and organizational skills, she is surely in charge of this whole thing and not just WHARGHARBL's misguided #1 fan.  The band"s roster includes professional musicians, experienced burners, and artists who enjoy cooperative subversion.  Production support comes in the form of professional lighting (Tyler Thompson) and sound (Aaron Bolding) as well as any other loyal subscribers who submit to the cause

In this application we"ve included in-progress previews of the WHARRGARBL production which we would prefer to keep private as well as public-facing CUDL marketing graphics which are free to be shared in both standard and banner sizing.

<h3>Power</h3><p>Yes</p>
<h3>Power Plan</h3><p>Self-provided gas generators for Sound & Lighting</p>
<h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3><p>No</p>
<h3>SafetyPlan</h3><p></p>
<h3>OtherProjects</h3><p>Brandt formed the band ~6 months ago to start rehearsing for the project.  Damien plays in multiple bands professionally, Joe has played in metal bands in the past, the frontman (Adrian) teaches and performs improv comedy professionally.  Winnie has produced dozens of live shows including at Flipside.

As part of Serious Camp Brandt & Winnie participated in projects with large pre-event time scales of organization such as filling a freezer full of homemade ice cream to pass out.  They also have executed event-spanning subversive art projects including [[redacted for the protection of certain board members]] which required small covert operations across the entire grounds during the burn.</p>
<h3>PastPojects</h3>

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>The MVP of the project (playing the actual music) has been already been achieved so the remaining work is focused on presentation and refinement.  Performer rehearsals and costume fabrication are ongoing and progressing.  A series of tech-oriented rehearsals are scheduled to test costumes, power, sound, and lighting ahead of the event alongside the weekly band practice sessions that have been happening.

Installation of the project will entail transporting instruments and other equipment from our camp to the effigy field near the ice truck.  A procession will bring audience members for the CUDL Crypto ICO and once the audience is gathered the show will begin.  Following the show, all equipment will be transported back to camp and secured.  Our team will do a full MOOP sweep following the show to ensure we have picked up any loose body parts, costum pieces, etc.  There will be nothing consumed other than generator power and water/gatorade</p>
