            <h1>Cloudseeder</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Cloudseeder is an interactive two-stage propane effect that will create the illusion of a skull blowing on a mushroom to seed a cloud of flames. This effect will be actuated by an electrical game that participants will play from a safe distance. Upon pressing the correct series of buttons, solenoid valves will open to facilitate ignition. Multiple safety valves are included in the plumbing design, as well as an emergency stop to disengage electrical signal and prevent ignition. All parts to build the plumbing portion will be water-oil-gas rated black iron, copper, and brass pipe and fittings. 
The skull will be constructed from electrical metallic tubing formed into a modified geodesic dome. The mushroom will be constructed from the same material. For connection points, the team will utilize a combination of electrical fittings and specialized nodes fabricated from sheet metal. Both sculptures will sit atop a box made of 2x4 and 1x3 lumber that will contain the plumbing components. 
We would ask for placement on the effigy field because we have experience setting up fuel depot safely in that location, as well as trenching the ground to bury gas hoses. As we will also be heavily involved in the effigy build, this ensures quick access to our tools and materials to bring this piece to life.

            <h3>Power</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>Yes. If we are granted placement on the effigy field, we will be able to draw from the service drop in that location. If we need to place this piece elsewhere, we would require two 20A circuits and could likely utilize one of our personal generators, if necessary. </p>

            <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
            <p>This piece incorporates flame effects, but is not designed to burn. Cloudseeder is made up of two essentially separate plumbing systems that will connect via manifold to the same 100lb propane tanks in our fuel depot. Multiple safety valves are included in the design of each system, as well as an emergency stop to disengage electrical signal and prevent ignition. All parts to build the plumbing portion will be water-oil-gas rated black iron, copper, and brass pipe and fittings. We will perform leak testing while building and on site prior to allowing anyone else to interact with the art. Someone will always be present to monitor safety while the effect is turned on. </p>
        
            <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
            <p>Artist 1-Edited is a journeyman electrician by trade who has participated in effigy builds for Flipside and Freezerburn events over the past four years. Flame effects are her favorite part of burns. She has helped design and build out multiple projects including Flamehorn and Second Shark (Freezerburn effigy 2020), Pipe Organ (Flipside effigy 2022), and Exothermia (Freezerburn 2023 art grant). 

Artist 2-Edited is a motorcycle mechanic with the daddest jokes around who has participated in effigy and other large-scale builds for Flipside, Freezerburn, and Burning Man over the last decade. He designed and built a low-pressure propane zen garden that was displayed along with the Flipside 2018 effigy. Artist 2-Edited has many years of experience tinkering with mechanical systems. 

Artist 3-Edited is a software engineer and troubleshooting master who has been the lead for several flame effects projects across Texas burn events over the past 10 years. His resume includes many of the projects that have been mounted on or next to recent Flipside and Freezerburn effigies, including Pyropod (Flipside 2018 art grant).

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Tweaking the geometric shape of the face is the only remaining planning for this project. The next step will be to order the many plumbing components and make a bulk lumber purchase. As Artist 2-Edited and Artist-3are DaFT lieutenants this year, they will be dedicating the rest of March to framing the effigy. At the beginning of April, they will start working on Cloudseeder. 
Fabricating connection nodes will be the most time-consuming and tedious part of this project. The Sketchup model gives us information about the angles for joinery, and we all have experience MIG welding. Preparing metal for nodes, and cutting/bending conduit will take up much of the month of April. 
Building out plumbing systems and stand boxes will be done in the first few weeks of May. The goal will be to have all the components together by the week prior to load-out so we can run ignition tests to make sure the system works as designed. 
We will plan to break down the skull structure into segments that can be more easily flat packed into our personal trucks and ferried to Apache Pass during load-out weekend. We hope to be able to work on building Cloudseeder on site concurrently with the effigy during the early entry period so that it will be ready to go by Friday at the latest.

            <h3>HowMuch</h3>
            <p>$1,000</p>
        
            <h3>PreviousFunding</h3>
            <p>As detailed in the attached budget, this project is likely to cost more than $1,000 especially including the $400 - $500 worth of fuel we hope to burn. We are all committed to seeing this piece displayed at Flipside 2023, and will split whatever costs the generosity of Ignition Philter does not cover. We have parts from previous projects that we will be able to repurpose for this one. We are also hoping to salvage whatever lumber, metal, and electrical metallic tubing we can from job site trash. </p>
