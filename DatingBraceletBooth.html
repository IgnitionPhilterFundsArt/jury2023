        <h3>Dating Bracelet Booth</h3><p>Dating Bracelet Booth is coming back to Flipside! The goal of DBB is to assist fellow burners with making love connections, whether it"s long term or for one night. It was designed with the purpose to especially assist non-neurotypicals and shy people, individuals of all sexual orientations and identities in being more confident with approaching others. The way it works is participants make a special bracelet that tells others that they are open to be approached but also what and who they are into. They are provided with a decoder card so they can easily identify those who might be interested in them before even starting a conversation. Love is in the air, but many of us need just a little help finding it.</p>

<h3>OtherProjects</h3><p>I was the maker of Rejuvenation Chambers that came to Flipside and FreezerBurn before covid and that project was the prototype for Mementomorium art project (https://www.mementomorium.org) that went to Burning Man in 2019. I have also made a large scale sign for the camp The Dream Spa with reflective blacklight paint. I have also designed an art called TexassAlamo that went to the LoveBurn and Apogea. Few pictures attached below. The Dating Bracelet Booth came to Flipside 2020 and was a huge success serving over 300 people. Pictures were included with the previous upload batch.</p>

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>The Bracelet Booth was brought to UBS and Flipside of 2022 and was loved by participants. I have decorated an enclosed 12x12 space, made laminated signs with explanations and instructions, obtained, drapes and bins. So now all I need to do is to print more "to go" code cards and replenish the beads and the bare bracelets of different sizes. I have added a floor tarp & a rug to assure that any dropped pieces can be easily picked up.</p>
<h3>HowMuch</h3><p>$575. My total cost will be more than that but I understand I will have to cover some of the costs out of pocket. However, I covered ALL costs last year (did not apply for the grant) and I can not do that again.</p>
<h3>PreviousFunding</h3><p>I have received funding from UBS to cover the cost of the beads used during that specific burn. $300.</p>
