        <h3>Dhaba Tacos</h3><p>
My other half and I have brought Dhaba Tacos to Flipside since 2018. It has grown each year and turned into an interactive food experience. Food is a vital part of every person's life but so many people are disconnected from their food and the people who prepare it. Dhaba Tacos is a project that strives to connect people to each other and their food through a shared culinary experience. We teach people how to make naan and some of the cultural history behind the food that goes with the naan. Of course we make people wash their hands first. 
We listened to the feedback from last year and assessed the needs of the community. At Freezer Burn 2023 The Dhaba served breakfast for the first time with great success. We also added a new menu item for participants to try their hand at.  This year Dhaba Tacos is planning of serving  175 to 200 participants Thursday evening and 50 participants Friday morning. We love kicking off the first night of Flipside with a well-received event.

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>Most of the work is done by myself in April and May. I like early entry on Wednesday to ensure that everything is ready by Thursday night. I might ask for help from Shaven Apes to put up the canopy. My other half and camp mates will help with set up and tear down everything. </p>
