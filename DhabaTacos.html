            <h1>Dhaba Tacos</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>
My other half and I have brought Dhaba Tacos to Flipside since 2018. It has grown each year and turned into an interactive food experience. Food is a vital part of every person's life but so many people are disconnected from their food and the people who prepare it. Dhaba Tacos is a project that strives to connect people to each other and their food through a shared culinary experience. We teach people how to make naan and some of the cultural history behind the food that goes with the naan. Of course we make people wash their hands first. 
We listened to the feedback from last year and assessed the needs of the community. At Freezer Burn 2023 The Dhaba served breakfast for the first time with great success. We also added a new menu item for participants to try their hand at.  This year Dhaba Tacos is planning of serving  175 to 200 participants Thursday evening and 50 participants Friday morning. We love kicking off the first night of Flipside with a well-received event.

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>A Dhaba is a roadside stand in India. Initially, they served mostly weary travelers, like truck drivers, good comfort food and masala chia tea on the cheap. Eventually, this street food evolved into some of the best and most unique cuisine India has to offer. Here at The Dhaba we recreate this unique Indian truck stop culinary experience for you, complete with rats and all. 
But wait there is more…..we are the cheapest dhaba in existence, but in order to keep our low low prices ($0), and save on labor, you must make your own food. Don’t worry, we will teach you (also for free)! So remember, wash your hands you dirty hippies, and get to work rolling your own delicious naan and samosa. 
Open Thursday night and now serving early breakfast Friday morning.

            <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
            <p>Dhaba Tacos has been brought to Flipside twice unfunded in a smaller scale. Last year was a recipient of a grant to bring it bigger and better. The Dhaba received and Mental Case Food grant at Freezer Burn 2023. All events were great successes. 
I know there are pictures out there, I don't own any of them. I will make sure to document the project when possible in the future. </p>

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>Most of the work is done by myself in April and May. I like early entry on Wednesday to ensure that everything is ready by Thursday night. I might ask for help from Shaven Apes to put up the canopy. My other half and camp mates will help with set up and tear down everything. </p>
