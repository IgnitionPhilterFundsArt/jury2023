        <h1>Disco Demolition PineCar Derby </h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>We are creating an arena and experience! The arena will consist of 4 ramps that meet in the center. Each ramp is about 3 feet high and 6-8 feet long (the surface is flexible, so exact length will be determined as we build). We hope to make a large arch between each opposite ramp, and drape with silver fabric to evoke a disco theme. A "disco plated" car will hang from the center of this canopy.  We are looking at light strips, paint, flag-banners, and other decor to enhance the festive atmosphere.

Pyropolites will be invited pre-event to make their own tiny art cars to show off, to race, and to smash into one another. We will have some car-making supplies and hand tools at Flipside for anyone who wants to create a car on the spot.
 We will have a DMV style check in. We will hold at least 2 formal exhibition/competition events. We may leave the arena open (if not abused) for use when we are not holding an event. We hope to have patches for participants and prizes - categories and prizes TBD.

</p>

        <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
        <p>Did you ever want to build an art car, but thought, "I don't have the space, bandwidth, cash to do that!"? Well THIS is your opportunity to build a pint-sized, pinewood (-based) car to show off (and maybe smash up!) at our Disco Demo Pinewood Derby! We are bringing the arena for all the action, a pit crew to help direct it, and prizes galore! Parameters for participant vehicles and opportunities to build them coming soon!</p>

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>Maybe</p>

        <h3>Power Plan</h3>
        <p>We may power some lights. We have solar, power bank, and battery options available to us. </p>

        <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
        <p>Maybe</p>

        <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
        <p>We plan on shaving bottle service-style sparklers. We can bring a small fire extinguisher. The arena is not designed to be climbable.</p>
        
        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>I had a major part in building Dr. Tiki for Flipside 2008, was one of 2 artists for Cathartica, a Flipside art piece in 2009,  was on the team with The Clocktower on Auditorium Shores and Fire of Fires at Burning Man 2009, and designed and led a team to build the Gallery of Dreams at Flipside in 2012. In 2020, I had a major project planned, and brought a scaled down version to Flipside in 2022. </p>

We hope to arrive Wednesday to Flipside and begin set up Thursday morning. The set up is fairly simple, and we hope to complete the piece Thursday, to be ready for our first Demolition Derby on Friday. Our second demolition Derby will be Saturday, and breakdown may happen Sunday, with a plan to be packed up and ready to go on Monday.</p>
