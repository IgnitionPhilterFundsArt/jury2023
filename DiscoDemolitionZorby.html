        <h1>Disco Demolition "Zorby"</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>The Disco Demolition "Zorby" is a zorb-based dance party in the spirit of a demolition derby!  (A zorb is basically an inflatable human-sized gerbil ball).  The idea is to build a 16 ft square fenced-in area, build a cool entryway in the spirit of old demolition derby race track, have zorbs for people to get into, where they can dance and bounce into each other for maximum non-destructive destruction!  There are two things that I think will make this unique.  The first is the sign will use individually addressable LEDs and arduinos to enable us to put in different messages, maybe some animations, etc.  It also gives us the ability to communicate some messages to the burn like "Burn is delayed due to marauding velociratpors!"  We can add that to the loop.  The next part is, the perimeter fence will have light panels of LEDs attached, that will hopefully be reactive to the music tempo/beat and modify the style to match the music being played.  It is technically possible, I've been researching it for awhile and its possible, but like all things art it takes time to make it the best possible.  (Apologies for the lack of CAD diagram, Sketchup went to $140 a year and FREECAD had a bigger learning curve than I anticipated).</p>

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>Yes</p>

        <h3>Power Plan</h3>
        <p>WIll be powered with generators.  I have access to one.</p>

        <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
        <p>Maybe</p>

        <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
        <p>It's not designed to be climbed but burners will climb anything if they have the opportunity...</p>
        
        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>Yes, my last large scale art project was "Water Temple" at Unbroken Spring.  We built a poofer and water pump and floated them in a pond.  The technical design went well, and it worked as intended.  My other smaller scale project was the "Illusion of usefulness" at Unbroken Spring, that also made it to Flipside.  It was a artistic toilet paper gifting station that I totally forgot to take pictures of.  At UBS it sat as far from any porto-potty as you could get to fit the title, but at Flipside it was closer.</p>

        <h3>TimeLine</h3>
        <p>The planning is already done.  Creation will start immediately once I have an approved art grant with the final installation prepped by 2 weeks out from flipside.  Installation would best be done Wednesday/Thursday during Early Entry, and LNT removal will occur on exodus day.</p>
        
        <h3>HowMuch</h3>
        <p>The total budget of this project is $1200.  I'm seeking $575 and plan to supplement that with fundraising and personal contribution.</p>
