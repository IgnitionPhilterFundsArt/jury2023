        <h1>Duck! a meditation</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>"Duck! a mediation" is a short film that I made in March of 2021. The film captures the movement of water as ocean waves roll into shore through one continuous 20 minute shot. As an art project for Flipside, I would love to project this film in a small peaceful space to act as a sanctuary for meditation, a small retreat from the activity and noise of the burn. The space would have the video projected onto a screen, on a loop, with the audio of the ocean waves. Cushions will be laid out for meditation/comfort for the viewers/participants. To really define the space, the area will be surrounded/adorned with large pieces of driftwood. Any funds provided would be put towards the purchase of a projector for the imagery and meditation cushions.</p>

        <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
        <p>"Duck! a meditation" is a small sanctuary set away from the noise of the burn for weary burners in need of a little peace. Enveloping viewers in the sounds of ocean waves and mesmerizing all with the ever-changing shape and color of water along the seashore, this visual and sound project shares one of Mother Nature's most soothing voices. Will you catch a glimpse of the duck?!</p>

        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>This is my first attempt to present my film in a public, interactive way. I have experience with simple laptop-projector setups for movie nights with friends, and this project will be that exact same setup, just open to more people. I have also done large scale interactive canvas painting at past burns, using a steel frame to mount the screen/sheet.</p>

        <h3>TimeLine</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving funds, necessary purchases for equipment will be made well in advance of the festival. Installment will require assistance from a couple of friends Friday afternoon, 5/26, for an hour or two. The screen frame and driftwood can be carried from our pick-up truck a fair distance, so vehicle access is not necessary. Each night at dark-thirty, I will begin the video, allowing it to run through the night powered by a generator, reassessing power the following day and repeating it the next night. The laptop will remain locked in the projector table. The projector and speakers will anchored to the table. All elements are large and will leave no trace upon removal besides a light footprint from the projector table and maybe from where participants have sat. Project will be fully cleared by Monday afternoon, 5/29.</p>
        
        <h3>HowMuch</h3>
        <p>I would like to request $575 to be put towards the cost of the projector and meditation cushions.</p>
