        <h3>Head Trip </h3><p>Head Trip is inspired by Matt Elson's infinity mirror lightboxes. A large & unassuming box on a platform, with openings on each end for a head and/or a camera to poke into. 

The interior box sides will be lined with mirror, and the floor and ceiling will be lined with original artwork and lighting. The effect creates an infinite landscape of eye candy. Folks can ask friends to take photos of their head peeking through, or simply enjoy the experience free of any media.  </p>

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>I plan to have Head Trip done by Flipside, and installation will take ~10min. The platform beneath it will also house the lightbox for transport and bad weather, and is a very not-moopy piece. </p>
