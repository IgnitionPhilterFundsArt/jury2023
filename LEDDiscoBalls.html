        <h1>LED Disco Balls</h1>
        <p>Each disco ball would be made of 92 3D printed rings that hold ping pong balls as a way to diffuse the addressable LED nodes. I have built one prototype already but would love to have funding to build at least 4 more. </p>

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>Yes</p>
        <h3>Power Plan</h3>
        <p>Camp will have power or I will bring small generator for project.</p>
        <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
        <p>No</p>

        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>I have done other projects in the past for Flipside. This particular project already has one ball made and I can share a video clip if necessary. The projects I have done in the past include Light Brite (2018), Glow Wall (2019), Robo Reckoning: Suckup Smack Down 2022.  </p>
        <h3>PastPojects</h3>
        <p>** nothing provided **</p>
        <h3>TimeLine</h3>
        <p>If I am awarded funding I can start construction on more of the balls. Each ball takes about a week to create. Installment will be hanging the balls in our camp for participants to view. I am hoping to be able to add an interactive element to the installation so folks can change the colors/patterns of the display. Leave no trace is easy as the balls will be just taken down and packed out. </p>
