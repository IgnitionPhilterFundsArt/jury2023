        <h1>Now What? </h1>
        <p>As a society, we have gone to great lengths to mechanize and automate much of the core human experience: Robots work our factories, prepare our food, and move us around; AI increasingly writes our news, makes our art, and even our music.  Sure, it's great to have a machine handle some of the drudgery of life, but I think that at the end of the day, we might be fucking ourselves a little.  So I am making a machine to even take care of that!

Now What is a fucking machine, that will only fuck itself.  Its power plant shall be an antique hit-or-miss engine (which I already have, and is an appropriately comical and arcane power source for this purpose).  It will have a belt drive going to a reciprocating mechanism (a Whitworth 4-bar quick return mechanism; I've landed on this for my design as it produces what I deem to be an acceptably hilarious motion path), on which will be mounted a large, floppy dildo, which will engage with a Fleshlight, also mounted to the machine.  A later goal will be to add a closed-loop "lubrication" system, to really j(a/i)zz it up.

So great, we have a machine that fucks itself.  Now What?

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>Yes</p>
        <h3>Power Plan</h3>
        <p>It will need rotational power, which will be provided by a comically intricate antique gas engine (a 1.5 HP 1932 Stover CT1 hit-or-miss engine).  Also probably a light or something. </p>
        <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
        <p>No</p>
        <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
        <p>It will be roped off to ensure that participants don't get a hand or something caught in there.  Yikes.</p>
        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>I was effigy lead for Flipside 2019 and for Freezerburn 2017.  For Flipside 2019, I created the walking mechanism used to make The Man "walk" up the mountain; for Freezerburn 2017, I built the "rocket" engine housed at the top of the structure (the metal ductwork and housings; Tim built the actual flame effect).  I also built Pyropod, a ~9' tall metal tripod / alien landing beacon thing, for Flipside 2018, and Suck It Osha, a wooden telehandler, for Flipside 2016.</p>
        <h3>PastPojects</h3>
        <p>** nothing provided **</p>
        <h3>TimeLine</h3>
        <p>The project will be on two separate wheeled carts that can simply be emplaced, and stowed when complete.  Tarps will be laid down to ensure no spillage of anything.</p>
        <h3>HowMuch</h3>
        <p>I'd be *very* surprised if there was much, if anything, left over from the default maximum of $575. 
 Much of the framework and linkages can be made from scrap metal already on-hand.  I will likely need to purchase several pulleys (to reduce the RPM of the input engine); these will probably be between $20 and $50 each.  I will also need to purchase the, ahem, "piston" and "cylinder" components, which seem to be probably $75-$100 each.  I can also reasonably assume around $100 worth of assorted components (fasteners, bushings, bearings, belts, etc).  I already have the input engine.  I am still working to assemble a formal budget, but a quick accounting of the strictly the main, known items (pulleys, jackshaft, piston, and cylinder) total up to about $370.  </p>
