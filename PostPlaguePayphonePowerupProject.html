        <h3>Post Plague Payphone Powerup Project</h3><p>F U Telecom is attempting to rebuild in a more lasting fashion after our pandemic hiatus and is in need of some assistance.  Much of our equipment was powered by lead acid batteries, and those batteries have a finite lifespan even when unused, not to mention they're extremely heavy!  We have a plan to build custom battery packs for our payphone stations using repurposed good condition lithium cells that will fit entirely inside the phone booths, locked away from unwanted participant vandalism and the elements, and that should last a solid decade or better rather than the 3 years the heavy lead batteries got us.   

For those unfamiliar with FU Telecom's phone booths, these are arted, brightly lit walk-up payphone booths set up generally on the edges of the event such as by the corral, badlands, greeters, etc, and they serve as both interactive art and as emergency coms people can use to contact Safety HQ, or just their friend in <insert theme camp with a phone.>  They feature a 10ft high pole with bright blue LEDs to make them easy to locate even across the field, and some of them have PA speakers we've been experimenting with that can play announcements/warnings/etc.  

F U Telecom has deployed these phones in several iterations at many events since 2016 to great effect, and are working hard to rebuild and build upon our experience and infrastructure to continue doing so at future Flipsides and other burn events in the future.  With this art grant, we can take a major step forward in doing so!  A $1000 grant gives us enough funding to buy the tools and cells to build batteries for a single phone booth which we can do testing with this year.  Each booth beyond the first will cost us substantially less and our fundraising may cover more of them, but the tooling to do the first one is a major roadblock hence we need help!</p>

<h3>Power</h3><p>Yes</p>
<h3>Power Plan</h3><p>We keep a generator running in camp 24/7, and have backups ready.</p>
<h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3><p>No</p>
<h3>SafetyPlan</h3><p></p>
<h3>OtherProjects</h3><p>Flipsides from 2016-2019, Myschievias from 2015-2019, Oblivium every year, and FIGMENT.  Some years were hard, some went great, we've learned from all of them and have been incubating ideas on how to do it better ever since! </p>

<h3>TimeLine</h3><p>Planning has been ongoing for months, creation begins the moment supplies are in hand.  Installment begins as early as they'll let me on the land (likely Tuesday), and it comes up Monday morning.</p>
<h3>HowMuch</h3><p>1000 doesnt fully cover it, but I'll make it work!</p>
<h3>PreviousFunding</h3><p>Ignition Philter!  Possibly Oblivium and Myschevia grants for some of the phone booths previously as well.  Am keeping as much of the original booth parts intact as possible and refurbing and building onto!</p>
