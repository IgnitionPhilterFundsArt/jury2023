            <h1>Stone Soup</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>Stone soup, for those familiar with the story (https://youtu.be/BZf60cb3Th8), is hopefully what one imagines.  It will be a meal prepared for the community and by the community.  We will be preparing a humble stone soup.  It begins with boiling water and a pair of soup stones to start the broth.  To make a richer, less thin broth, other ingredients may be added.  Anyone who wishes to can offer up ingredients -- fruits, vegetables, proteins, etc -- and our cook will decide if it is added, how much, and what preparations need done in advance to ensure an edible final product.  One of the best part about this art project is that it highlights the kind of community we are.  The more people participate and chip in, the more the community gets out of it.  If people don't, then it is just a pair of (food-safe) stones in a cauldron of water.

To help with the scale of the project, we're hoping to acquire a large cast iron cauldron (several gallons) and an appropriate heating element.</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>Join in a decadent feast!  We will be bringing some excellent stones for making our broth, which will be plenty for us and to share.  Still, though, a little salt, some protein, vegetables, and more can make this a still finer festivity!  Add a crust of bread on the side, maybe some cheese, and who knows how finely we may dine.  Come early to contribute or come at the serving time and enjoy some Stone Soup.</p>

            <h3>Power Plan</h3>
            <p>It will need heat, and we will be providing such.</p>

            <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
            <p>I have put on a number of theater festivals, and there is a theatrical element to this.  I am a founder of two improv theaters and an amateur cook.  I will have other cooks assisting me and tracking ingredients to assist those with dietary restrictions.</p>

            <h3>TimeLine</h3>
            <p>The longest part of the project onsite is getting the water boiling.  Depending on the scale we can manage, we will be either boiling the water in the pot directly or boiling separately and then adding to the large cauldron where it will be kept hot.  One of the sizes we are hoping to get is a little under 14 gallons.  To assist with clean up and making sure we leave no trace, we would be bringing a number of sealable 5-gallon drums.  Any excess food and waste will be stored in there and transported for disposal.</p>
        
            <h3>HowMuch</h3>
            <p>867 (less is likely manageable, but much less than the $575 will likely be prohibitive to the scale, if not the project entirely)</p>
