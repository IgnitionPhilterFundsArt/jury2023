        <h1>SunStreak</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>SunStreak is a freestanding 3D printed solar powered LED tower.

The base unit is a printed hexagonal enclosure attached to a wooden platform and ringed by 6 printed pods containing the solar panels.  The base is a fully self contained solar power unit, containing the solar panels, battery charging and LED control electronics, and the lithium-ion battery pack itself.  The base fits within a 3 foot circle and is on the order of 8-12 inches in height.

The tower unit is a segmented 3d printed tower containing 500-600 LEDs arranged vertically in 3 equally spaced arrays placed within the tower.  The tower height is around 8 to 10 feet (final height is TBD).  The tower will break down into 2-3 sections to enable easy transport in a conventional vehicle.  The tower is printed in clear PETG, a material chosen for its UV stability, dimensional accuracy, and excellent optical clarity.

The overall height of SunStreak is on the order of 9 to 11 feet.  The structure is designed to place the majority of the weight as low as possible in the base unit and includes the possibility of additional ballast weighting as needed.  Hidden below the solar pods are 6 wooden legs which will screw stake into the ground to provide additional stability in high winds.</p>

        <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
        <p>A 10 (ish) foot tall solar powered LED extravaganza.  Over 500 individual channels of photonic output with fully programmable wavelength filters to project any vibe to any moderately sized outdoor environment.  Compatible with remote fusion reactors placed up to 100 million miles away.  Extended range battery pack enables operation during periods of limited reactor exposure.  Includes standard radio interfaces for remote command and control.  SunStreak is suitable for placement in environments between 0.5 and 1.5 standard gravities and moderate pressure, low oxidizer atmospheres.  Call now to preorder!

        <h3>Power</h3>
        <p>No</p>

        <h3>Power Plan</h3>
        <p>SunStreak is solar powered and requires no external support.  In the sad event of minimal sunlight for charging, a DC charge port will be included to allow it to top off from a portable generator.  I generally oversize my battery packs to provide at least 2 nights of lighting power without sunlight.</p>

        <h3>Flame/Movable/Climbable</h3>
        <p>No</p>

        <h3>SafetyPlan</h3>
        <p>No flame effects, no moveable parts, and I don't think it looks very climbable.

The battery system incorporates multiple layers of software and hardware safety mechanisms, including fuses, thermal cut offs, and fan cooling to prevent overcharging, overheating, and shorted circuits.

        <h3>OtherProjects</h3>
        <p>I have extensive experience with 3D printed LED art.  Much of my work is showcased at the SparkEasy (voted #1 bar every year!).  I am also an electrical engineer with over 16 years of industry experience including LED lighting and wirelessly connected devices.

SunStreak is a direct evolution of 2 years of R&D into solar powered LED art.  The core power electronics and LED control system is custom designed for this application and has been proven through multiple installations across multiple burns.  The mechanical structure is informed by previous pieces, including one that showcased at Flipside 2022.  

In 2019 Artist 2-Edited and I debuted the Transdimensional Portal Generator aka The Pyramid at Freezerburn: a 12 foot pyramid incorporating almost 4000 LEDs.  We brought it to multiple burns in 2019 (though unfortunately Flipside was not one of them).  Artist 2 is assisting with the design and fabrication of the structural base components for SunStreak.

In 2022 I created the Gravity Wave Projector aka The Shard, which was placed on the effigy field at Flipside.  This was a smaller scale solar powered LED tower.  It then found a home in my backyard until the combined effects of weather and a poorly designed mechanical structure caused it to collapse.  The electronics package and solar panels survived without injury and will be reused for SunStreak.  The mechanical issues in the Shard's design are directly influencing the design of SunStreak.</p>
