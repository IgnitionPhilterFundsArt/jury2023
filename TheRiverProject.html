            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>This is a performance art piece for Burning Flipside 2023 that takes advantage of a feature of the land the event is held on to intentionally violate the rule of “No Commerce.” Sales will be conducted legally inside the public waterway or just on the bank, and all profits will be donated to art projects for Flipside 2024 (or another event.) To avoid copycats or advance-war-planning, this project will not be publicized much in advance. However, all financials and other documentation will be made public at the end of the event.  1) We'll be selling items folks might forget at home and need at Flipside. So bug repellant, sunscreen, toothbrushes, wet wipes, lighters, spare flatware, stakes sunglasses, etc. 

No items which require special regulations or permitting (no alcohol, tobacco, food prepared on site, etc) will be sold.

2) At this time I believe we have the capacity and safety planning to run this about 6AM-8PM Saturday and Sunday. If we expand times, likely we. Would add times on Friday afternoon/evening.

            <p>Yes! 16 yrs experience in the events industry. One performance art project bigger than this in 2010 in terms of work but maybe not impact. Many performance art projects almost this size and smaller. 
Completed a successful grant project for FZB 2023 with my kidd.</p>
