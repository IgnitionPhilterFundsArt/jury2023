        <h1>The River Project</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
        <p>This is a performance art piece for Burning Flipside 2023 that takes advantage of a feature of the land the event is held on to intentionally violate the rule of "No Commerce." Sales will be conducted legally inside the public waterway or just on the bank, and all profits will be donated to art projects for Flipside 2024 (or another event.) To avoid copycats or advance-war-planning, this project will not be publicized much in advance. However, all financials and other documentation will be made public at the end of the event.
