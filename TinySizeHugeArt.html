        <h3>Tiny Size - Huge Art</h3><p>I think as Burners we are drawn to the idea of BIG art.  Huge projects that can be climbed, gazed at, and set on fire. We want to flip this idea and reverse it.  

TINY size - huge ART
 
We will be bringing a gumball machine that dispenses 2" domes.  We are asking for submissions of ORIGINAL art of ALL kinds. (please see attached flyer) 

EVERYONE can make art....the only limitation is your imagination!  THINK TINY!</p>
