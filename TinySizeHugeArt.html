            <h1>Tiny Size - Huge Art</h1>
            <hr/>

            <h3>Description for the Jury</h3>
            <p>I think as Burners we are drawn to the idea of BIG art.  Huge projects that can be climbed, gazed at, and set on fire. We want to flip this idea and reverse it.  

TINY size - huge ART
 
We will be bringing a gumball machine that dispenses 2‚Äù domes.  We are asking for submissions of ORIGINAL art of ALL kinds. (please see attached flyer) 

EVERYONE can make art....the only limitation is your imagination!  THINK TINY!</p>

            <h3>Description for the Website</h3>
            <p>I think as Burners we are drawn to the idea of BIG art.  Huge projects that can be admired, climbed, and set on fire. We want to flip this idea and reverse it.  

TINY size - huge ART
 
We are asking for submissions of ORIGINAL art of ALL kinds in ANY medium......fiber art, paintings, fabric art, poems, a song BUT each piece must fit in a TWO INCH plastic gumball machine CAPSULE!  That's right, 2" capsule!  

PLEASE drop off your original art pieces during FS at the DMV or if you're not making it this year please get art works to someone that is!

EVERYONE can make art....the only limitation is your imagination!  THINK TINY!</p>
