SunStreak budget:


Most of SunStreak's components are items I already have: solar panels, battery packs, electronics, LEDs, wiring, connectors, etc.  Some of the wood for the base unit will come from another cancelled project (that happens to be the exact right size).

We are looking to fund the structural materials: additional wood, printer filament, and misc supplies/hardware that we don't already have.

Unspent funds will be donated back to Ignition Philter.


12 kg PETG filament: $20 per 1 kg spool * 12 = $240.
    - My estimate for the tower itself comes in at around 5 kg.  As I haven't completed the engineering design, I will probably need extra filament for additional structural support and mounting interfaces.  That probably adds 1-3 kg to the tower.
    - The remaining spools are budgeted for the base unit, print tests, and to have enough extra for the inevitable failed print.
    - Any filament leftover from this project will inevitably end up in some other LED artwork that shows up to a Texas burn.

Plywood: $50
    - I'm aiming a bit high here.  Wood can be expensive these days and I'd like some headroom to add additional wood to the design if needed as we get into the build.  We will buy wood in the smaller size needed to minimize waste.  $50 covers an entire 4x8 sheet of plywood - though realistically I think we'll get away with a 2x2 sheet.

Additional supplies: $50
    - Wood glue, paint, silicone sealant, and misc hardware (such as bolts) that we don't already have.

That adds up to $390, so let's round that up to $400 - that's our ask to fund this piece.  We will be as economical as we can and can donate any excess back to Ignition Philter.
